                                    A famous left-authoritarian politician is Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. Stalin combined Marxist-Leninist ideology with an authoritarian governance style, consolidating power through centralized control of the economy, extensive propaganda, and political purges. His policies, including the Five-Year Plans and collectivization of agriculture, aimed to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union but also led to widespread repression and famine.</p>

                                <p>Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, is often described as a right-wing authoritarian leader due to his governance style and political ideology. Since taking office in 2010 (and previously serving from 1998 to 2002), Orbán has pursued policies and actions that consolidate power, restrict opposition, and challenge democratic norms.</p>
